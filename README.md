## üî¨ [COLLOID_AEROSOL](./COLLOID_AEROSOL)

**Problem:** Measuring the zeta potential is traditionally experimental, time-consuming, and expensive.

**Solution:** Developed a machine learning pipeline to predict zeta potential from easily measurable physico-chemical variables. Includes preprocessing, regression modeling, and interpretability via feature importance.

## üåä [FLUID_DYNAMICS](./FLUID_DYNAMICS)

**Problem:** Understanding the motion of gas bubbles in viscoelastic fluids‚Äîa critical phenomenon in chemical engineering, biomedical applications, and inkjet tech.

**Solution:** Applied the Rayleigh‚ÄìPlesset equation adapted for non-Newtonian flow. Analysed phase-space behavior to identify key fluid-bubble interactions.

## ‚ô®Ô∏è [THERMODYNAMICS](./THERMODYNAMICS)

**Problem:** How do you design an energy-efficient thermal accumulator that doesn‚Äôt violate mass or energy?

**Solution:** Constructed a thermodynamic model balancing mass and energy flows. Simulated design scenarios for an accumulator under variable heat input. Verified performance under industrial constraints using iterative methods.

## üö∞ [WATER_RESORVOIR_DASHBOARD](./WATER_RESORVOIR_DASHBOARD)

**Problem:** Raw hydrological data from Indian water reservoirs lacks decision-ready insights for water resource planning.

**Solution:** Built an interactive Power BI dashboard using CWC (Central Water Commission) datasets. Enabled visual analytics on seasonal trends, capacity utilization, and reservoir health‚Äîbridging the gap between data and decision-makers.
